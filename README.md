**Before submitting any changes**
- Make sure it is useful and optimized for the general public. (Ex. fps cap to replace vsync > most people has 60Hz monitor therefore 60.)
- Comment your functions and intentions clearly.

*It has come to the state where I cannot respond to Dota 2 updates and cfg changes as quickly as I used to be able to.
Due to this, I decided to make the CFG open source and allow anyone to contribute to the CFG. I will monitor the requests daily and respond as soon as possible. (I will still work on the cfg.)
Thank you for your support. See you in game. :)*
